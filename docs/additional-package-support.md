## PWA <Badge text="v1.2.0" />

To have the PWA feature for `theme-melody`, you need to do the following things:

1. Go to the hexo site folder
2. `npm install hexo-offline --save` or `yarn add hexo-offline`
3. Modify `_config.yml`
Add the following to the site `_config.yml`.

```yaml
# offline config passed to sw-precache.
offline:
  maximumFileSizeToCacheInBytes: 10485760 # The maximum file size cached, in bytes
  staticFileGlobs:
    - public/**/*.{js,html,css,png,jpg,gif,svg,webp,eot,ttf,woff,woff2}
  # Static file collection, if your site uses files such as webp format, please add the file type.
  stripPrefix: public
  verbose: true
  runtimeCaching:
    # CDNs - should be cacheFirst, since they should be used specific versions so should not change
    - urlPattern: /* # If you need to load CDN resources, please configure this option. If not, you can configure it.
      handler: cacheFirst
      options:
        origin: your_website_url # can be replaced with your url
```
For more details, please see the official documentation for [hexo-offline](https://github.com/JLHwung/hexo-offline)

4. Turn on the pwa option in `melody.yml`.

```yaml
pwa:
  enable: true
  manifest: # the url for the manifest.json, usually you can set to /manifest.json
  # Since v1.5.6 you can modify the theme_color & icon for your PWA app.
  # If you don't want to trouble, just ignore the following things
  # See https://realfavicongenerator.net/
  # theme_color: "#1B9EF3"
  # apple_touch_icon: /apple-touch-icon.png
  # favicon_32_32: /favicon-32x32.png
  # favicon_16_16: /favicon-16x16.png
  # mask_icon: /safari-pinned-tab.svg
```
5. Create a `manifest.json` file in the `source/` directory.
```json
{
    "name": "string", //Application full name
    "short_name": "Junzhou", //Application short name
    "theme_color": "#49b1f5", //Match the browser's address bar color
    "background_color": "#49b1f5",//Background color when loading the app
    "display": "standalone",//Preferred display mode Other options are: fullscreen, minimal-ui, browser
    "scope": "/",
    "start_url": "/",
    "icons": [ //The array specifies the icons icon parameter, which is used to adapt to different devices (requires png, at least one icon of 192px*192px)
        {
          "src": "images/pwaicons/36.png", //The directory of the icon file needs to be created by itself in the source/ directory.
          "sizes": "36x36",
          "type": "image/png"
        },
        {
            "src": "images/pwaicons/48.png",
          "sizes": "48x48",
          "type": "image/png"
        },
        {
          "src": "images/pwaicons/72.png",
          "sizes": "72x72",
          "type": "image/png"
        },
        {
          "src": "images/pwaicons/96.png",
          "sizes": "96x96",
          "type": "image/png"
        },
        {
          "src": "images/pwaicons/144.png",
          "sizes": "144x144",
          "type": "image/png"
        },
        {
          "src": "images/pwaicons/192.png",
          "sizes": "192x192",
          "type": "image/png"
        },
        {
            "src": "images/pwaicons/512.png",
            "sizes": "512x512",
            "type": "image/png"
          }
      ],
      "splash_pages": null //Configure a custom launch animation.
  }
```

You can also quickly create `manifest.json` via [Web App Manifest](https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com/). (Web App Manifest requires at least one 512*512 pixel icon)

6. You can check if the PWA configuration is in effect and the configuration is correct through the `Chrome` plugin `Lighthouse`.
    - Open the blog page
    - Launch the `Lighthouse` plugin (the `Lighthouse` plugin requires at least one 512*512 pixel icon)

## Live2D Animated model pendant

### Installation

#### Live2D model

Use the following command to install the `Live2D` module, which needs to be executed in the `root` directory of the blog through the terminal:

```yaml
npm install --save hexo-helper-live2d
```

If you don't want to use it and want to uninstall it completely, the command is as follows:

```yaml
npm uninstall hexo-helper-live2d
```

#### Configure your favorite animated model

There are a lot of `Live2D` animation models for us to choose from:

  1.The corresponding module is downloaded [here](https://github.com/xiazeyu/live2d-widget-models)

For example, I use `tororo(Cute White Cat)`, which can be directly in the download interface above:

  1.After the manual download is complete, copy all the files in `packages` to the `node_modules` folder in the root directory of the blog.

  2.It can also be installed using the package manager. The command format: `npm install model package name` will also be installed in the `node_modules` directory.

  3.Open the configuration file `_config.yml` of the blog root directory and add the following content:

```yaml
# Live2D
live2d:
  enable: true
# enable: false
  scriptFrom: local # default
  pluginRootPath: live2dw/ # Plugin on the root of the site
  pluginJsPath: lib/ # Script file relative to the plugin root directory path
  pluginModelPath: assets/ # Model file relative to plugin root directory path
  model:   
    use: live2d-widget-model-tororo # Downloaded animated model name
  display:
    superSample: 2
    width: 210
    height: 420
    position: left # Where the model is displayed on the web page
    hOffset: 0
    vOffset: -20
```


Go and pick up your cute white cat!
