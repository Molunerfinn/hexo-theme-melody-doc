if you want to choose a specific version of `theme-melody`

For example, get into the `themes/melody` folder and then

`git checkout tags/v1.0` > Change the theme version to v1.0

if you want to try the latest feature of `theme-melody`, you can use the `dev` branchï¼š

```
git checkout dev
```

!> All the new features in the dev branch is not stable & no docs for you to setup! You should read the dev branch commits history by yourself.

## Setup

Set theme in the hexo work folder's root config file `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: melody
```

!> If you don't have pug & stylus renderder, please `npm install hexo-renderer-pug hexo-renderer-stylus --save` or `yarn add hexo-renderer-pug hexo-renderer-stylus`

## Configuration

For smoothly update, `theme-melody` use the [data files](https://hexo.io/docs/data-files.html) feature.

It's recommonded that copy the theme default config file `_config.yml` to the hexo work folder `source/_data/melody.yml`. If the folder don't exist, create one.

!> Notice that, if you create the `melody.yml`, it will replace the default settings of the theme `_config.yml` (**Not merge, but replace**)

After that, you can update `theme-melody` smoothly by just `git pull`.
