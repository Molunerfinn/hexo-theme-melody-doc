## Configuration

::: warning
**Notice: The configuration file before and after hexo 5.0 version is different.**
:::

### Hexo version >= 5.0 <Badge text="theme-melody v1.8.0+" />

1. create a `_config.melody.yml` in your hexo work folder.
2. copy the contents of `./node_modules/hexo-theme-melody/_config.yml` (so you should install `hexo-theme-melody` first.) to `_config.melody.yml`.
3. If you have used `hexo-theme-melody` for a long time, and has a `melody.yml`, please copy the contents of `melody.yml` to `_config.melody.yml` & remove `melody.yml` since it will be deprecated.

After that, you can update `theme-melody` smoothly by just `npm update hexo-theme-melody`.

### Hexo version < 5.0

For smoothly update, `theme-melody` use the [data files](https://hexo.io/docs/data-files.html) feature.

It's recommended that copy the theme default config file `_config.yml` to the hexo work folder `source/_data/melody.yml`. If the folder don't exist, create one.

::: warning
Notice that, if you create the `melody.yml`, it will replace the default settings of the theme `_config.yml` (**Not merge, but replace**)
:::

After that, you can update `theme-melody` smoothly by just `git pull`.
